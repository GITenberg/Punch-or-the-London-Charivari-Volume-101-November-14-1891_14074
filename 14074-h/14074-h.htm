    <h2>LETTERS TO ABSTRACTIONS.</h2>

    <h3>No. VI.&mdash;TO VANITY.</h3>

    <p>DEAR VANITY,</p>

    <p>I think I can see you smirking and posturing before the
    abstract mirror, which is your constant companion. It pleases
    you, no doubt, to think that anybody should pay you the
    compliment of making you the object and the subject of a whole
    letter. Perhaps when you have read it to the end you will alter
    your mood, since it cannot please you to listen to the truth
    about yourself. None of those whom you infect here below ever
    did like it. Sometimes, to be sure, it had to be endured with
    many grimaces, but it was extraordinary to note how the clouds
    caused by the aggravated truth-teller passed away as soon as
    his departure had enabled the object of these reproaches to
    recover his or her false self again. What boots it, after all,
    to tell the truth? For those whom you protect are clad in
    armour, which is proof against the sharpest lance, and they can
    thus bid defiance to all the clumsy attacks of the merely
    honest and downright&mdash;for a time; but in the end their
    punishment comes, not always in the manner that their friends
    predict, but none the less inevitable in one manner or another.
    For they all fashion a ridiculous monster out of affectations,
    strivings and falsehoods, and label it "Myself;" and in the end
    the monster takes breath, and lives and crushes his despised
    maker, and immediately vanishes into space.</p>

    <p>Permit me to proceed in my usual way, and to offer you an
    example or two. And I begin with HERMIONE MAYBLOOM. HERMIONE
    was one of a large family of delightful daughters. Their father
    was the well-known Dr. MAYBLOOM, who was Dean of Archester
    Cathedral. His massive and convincing volumes on <i>The Fauna
    and Flora of the Mosaic Books in their Relation to Modern
    Botanical Investigation</i>, must be within your recollection.
    It was followed, you remember, by <i>The Dean's Duty</i>,
    which, being published at a time when there was, so to speak, a
    boom in religious novels, was ordered by many readers under the
    impression that it was likely to upset their mature religious
    convictions by its assaults on orthodoxy. Their disappointment
    when two stout tomes, dealing historically with the
    <i>status</i> and duties of Deans, were delivered to them, was
    the theme of cheerful comment amongst the light-hearted members
    of the Dean's own family.</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:50%;">
        <a href="images/229.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/229.png"
             alt="The Reverend Stephen Hankinson." /></a>
    </div>

    <p>Was there ever in this world so delightful a family circle
    as that of the Deanery? The daughters were all pretty, but that
    was their smallest merit. They were all clever, and well-read,
    without a tinge of the bluestocking, and most of them were
    musical to the tips of their slender fingers. How merrily their
    laughter used to ring across the ancient close, and how
    playfully and gently they used to rally the dear learned old
    Dean who had watched over them and cared for them since Mrs.
    MAYBLOOM'S death, many years before, with all the tender care
    of the most devoted mother. And of this fair and smiling
    throng, "my only rosary," as the Dean used to call them,
    HERMIONE was, I think, the prettiest, as she was certainly the
    most accomplished. Every kind of gift had been showered upon
    her by Nature. When she played her violin, accompanied by her
    elder sister on the piano, tears trickled unbidden down the
    aquiline nose of the militant Bishop of Archester, the chapter
    stood hushed to a man, and the surrounding curates were only
    prevented by a salutary fear of ruining their chances of
    preferment from laying themselves, their pittances, and their
    garnered store of slippers at her pretty feet. Then in a fit of
    charming petulance, she would break off in the middle of the
    piece, lay down her violin, and, with a pretty imperiousness,
    command a younger sister to fetch her zither, on which to
    complete the subjugation of her adorers. And then her
    caricatures&mdash;summer-lightning flashes of pencilled wit, as
    I heard the Reverend SIMEON COPE describe them in a moment of
    enthusiasm after she had shown us her sketch of his rival, the
    Reverend STEPHEN HANKINSON.</p>

    <p>But even in those days, while she still had about her all
    the fascinations of peerless beauty and fresh and glowing
    youth, I mistrusted her. Alone of all the sisters she seemed to
    me to be wanting in heart. I heard her several times attempt to
    snub her father, and once I noted how she spent a whole evening
    in moody silence, and refused to play a note, for no other
    reason that I could see except that Captain ARBLAST, of the
    30th Lancers, the dashing first-born of the Bishop, who
    happened to be spending a few days of his long leave in
    Archester, devoted himself with all the assiduity of his
    military nature to twirling his heavy moustache in the
    immediate neighbourhood of SOPHY MAYBLOOM, and not in that of
    HERMIONE. Indeed, I have reason to know that, after the guests
    had departed, poor SOPHY had to endure from her sister a
    dreadful scene, the harsh details of which have not yet faded
    from her memory. And then I remembered, too, how it was a
    matter of family chaff against HERMIONE that once, not very
    long after she had entered upon her teens, she had sobbed
    convulsively through a whole night, because she had discovered
    that her juvenile arms were thin and mottled, and she imagined
    that she would never be able to wear a low dress, or shine in
    Society.</p>

    <p>Such, then, was the beautiful HERMIONE, who for some years
    rode rough-shod over the hearts of all the males in Archester.
    Space fails me to enumerate all her engagements. She broke them
    one after another without a thought, and cast her admirers away
    as if they had been dresses of last year's fashion. Most of
    them, it must be said, recovered quickly enough, but the
    miserable COPE became a hopeless hypochondriac, and never
    smiled again. He died the other day, and HERMIONE's sketch of
    HANKINSON was found, frayed and soiled, in an ancient
    pocket-book which he always carried about with him. HANKINSON'S
    fate seemed at first to be worse. He took to poetry, morbid,
    passionate, yearning, unhealthy poetry, of the skimmed
    SWINBURNE variety, and for a time was gloomy enough. Having,
    however, engaged in a paper conflict with one of his critics,
    he forgot his sorrows, and though he still declares an
    overwhelming desire for death and oblivion about six times a
    year, in various magazines, he seemed, when I last saw him,
    fairly comfortable and happy. But, of course, he has never
    secured a vicarage.</p>

    <p>To return to HERMIONE. She at last married a certain Mr.
    PARDOE, a barrister practising on the Archester Circuit, and
    established herself in town. Shortly afterwards she became the
    rage. Her beauty, her wit, her music, her dinners, her
    diamonds, were spoken of with enthusiasm. All the elderly
    <i>rou&eacute;s</i>, whose leathery hearts had been offered up
    at hundreds of shrines, became her temporary slaves. She coaxed
    them, cajoled them, and fooled them, did this innocent daughter
    of a simple-minded Dean, to the top of their various bents. She
    schemed successfully against countless rivals, in order to
    maintain her pre-eminence in the admiration of her circle. Her
    ambition knew no bounds. She changed her so-called friends
    every week; she cultivated grand passions for actors, authors,
    musicians, and even for professors. Sometimes she played to
    select audiences with all her old ravishing skill, but this
    happened more and more rarely, until at last she utterly
    declined, and even went so far as to flout H.S.H. the Duke of
    KALBSKOPF, who had been specially invited to meet her.</p>

    <p>Then suddenly came the crash. She left her husband, in
    company with CHARLIE FITZHUBERT, the heir presumptive to the
    wealthy earldom of Battersea. On the following day Mr. PARDOE
    blew out his brains, leaving ten thousand pounds of debt and
    three young children. Six months afterwards the venerable Dean
    died, and sentimental people spoke of a broken heart. Then the
    Earl of BATTERSEA, in a fit of indignation, married, and was
    blessed with a son, the present Earl. CHARLIE FITZHUBERT
    married HERMIONE, but they are as poor as curates, and he hates
    her. I saw her two days ago in a shabby hired carriage. She is
    getting prematurely old, and grey, and wrinkled, and everybody
    avoids her, except her sister SOPHY, who still visits her, and
    suffers her ill-humour.</p>

    <p>Charming story, isn't it? I shall write again soon.</p>

    <p>Yours, in the meantime,<br />
     DIOGENES ROBINSON.</p>

    <p>NIGHT-MAILING.&mdash;"Night Mail between London and Paris"
    has been recently announced in all the papers as now ready and
    willing to take night-mailers from Victoria, L.C. &amp; D., to
    the French Capital. It is to be a Third-class Night Mail,
    though a Knight of the First Class can, of course, travel by it
    should he be so disposed. Thirty shillings through fare for "a
    single;" but as the tariff doesn't explicitly inform us whether
    the passenger will be asked the question, "Married or single?"
    and so be charged accordingly, we may presume that a margin is
    left for a little surprise. The train of Night Mails&mdash;a
    kind of gay bachelor train, no females being of the
    party&mdash;is to start at 8:15 P.M., and to be in Paris at
    5:50 A.M.</p>

    <h2>DRAWING THE BADGER.</h2>

    <p class="center">(<i>A Natural History Note</i>.)</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:100%;">
        <a href="images/230.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/230.png"
             alt="The Badger" /></a>
    </div>

    <p>The Badger (<i>Meles-Taxus</i>) is at once one of the most
    inoffensive and (in one sense) offensive of our few remaining
    British Carnivora. He is described by NAPIER of Merchiston, in
    his <i>Book of Nature and of Man</i>, as a "quiet nocturnal
    beast, but if much 'badgered' becoming obstinate, and fighting
    to the last, in which it is a type of a large class of Britons,
    who like to be let alone, but when ill used can fight."</p>

    <p>That great new authority on Natural History, Mr. G.A. HENTY
    (author of <i>Those Other Animals</i>), should be able to tell
    us much about the Badger. Therewith he would be able, in his
    own favourite fashion, to "point a moral" (against the
    Demogorgon Democracy), and "adorn a tale" (of laboured
    waggery). He might find the subject as suggestive of sardonic
    chaff as American women and Republican institutions.</p>

    <p>What says the popular WOOD? He describes the Badger as "slow
    and clumsy in its actions," and as "rolling along so awkwardly
    that it may easily be mistaken for a young pig in the dusk of
    the evening." Woe, however, to whomsoever <i>does</i> take the
    creature for "a young pig." "Being naturally as harmless an
    animal as can be imagined, it is a terrible antagonist when
    provoked to use the means of defence with which it is so well
    provided."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"
       id="page231"></a>[pg 231]</span>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>We tax the patience of poor <i>Meles-Taxus</i>,</p>

            <p>Until he turns with tooth and claws and whacks
            us.</p>

            <p>The natural home of <i>Taxus</i>&mdash;the
            Exchequer&mdash;</p>

            <p>Harbours a creature that keeps up its pecker.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"For the purpose of so-called 'sport,' the Badger used to be
    captured and put into a cage ready to be tormented; at the
    cruel will of every ruffian who might chose to risk his dog
    against the sharp teeth of the captive animal."</p>

    <p>This particular sort of "sport" is a little out of date. But
    "drawing a Badger" is not unknown even in these humanitarian
    days. Dogs will sometimes voluntarily rush in to risk their
    hides and muzzles against the aforesaid sharp teeth, &amp;c.
    Look at those in the picture!</p>

    <p>The two small, if aggressive, terriers seem unequally
    matched against the "clumsy" but strong-jawed and
    terribly-toothed Badger. They have drawn him, indeed, out of
    his hole, and one of them, at least, seems rather sorry for it,
    if you may judge by the way in which he turns tail and makes
    for his protector, the big Bull-Terrier. The ventripotent
    broken-haired tyke looks more valorous&mdash;for the moment.
    Yap! yap! yap! <i>Meles-Taxus</i> takes little notice of him,
    however. His eyes are on that sturdy specimen of <i>Canis
    familiaris</i> there, whose bold eyes in turn are on
    <i>him</i>. Both, perhaps, experience&mdash;</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>That stern joy which warriors feel</p>

            <p>In foemen worthy of their steel."</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>"Drawn by those two tiny yelpers? Not a bit of it! But
    <i>you</i>, my complacent canine Colossus&mdash;come on if you
    dare!" And he <i>does</i> dare, evidently. Whether he'll regret
    his daring remains to be seen.</p>

    <p>Mr. HENRY AUTHOR JONES has taken a theatre wherein to play
    his own plays to his own taste. On the first night of <i>The
    Crusaders</i> this taste was not exactly the taste of the
    audience. Mr. HENRY AUTHOR JONES seemed to object to be tied to
    time, and the result was the prompt appearance of that terrible
    conqueror of things terrestrial, General Boredom. Since the
    initial performance, it is reported that matters have gone on
    more smoothly. According to the "usual sources of information"
    the dramatist has been cheered on leaving his theatre, and
    heartily congratulated. On one occasion he actually
    supplemented his piece with a speech! Apparently he was under
    the impression that there could not be too much of a good
    thing&mdash;JONES for choice! It may be that since the first
    performance, there has been some curtailment made in the play.
    To judge from appearances it was a question of
    cutting&mdash;either the author the play, or the public the
    theatre!</p>
    <hr />

    <p>QUITE A NEW SPEC.&mdash;We have just received a prospectus
    of a Company entitled "<i>The Monarch Insurance Society</i>."
    Of course, all the Crowned Heads of Europe will be in it. We
    haven't yet read it, the title being sufficient for the
    present. <i>&Ccedil;a donne &agrave; penser</i>. Will it
    provide New Monarchs for old ones? Will it give good sovereigns
    in exchange for bad ones? If so&mdash;where will the profit
    come in?</p>

    <h4>FRENCH AS SHE IS "WRIT."</h4>

    <p>The <i>Standard's</i> own Vienna Correspondent, when
    reporting the unpleasant incident in the life of the Duc
    d'ORL&Eacute;ANS, told us how the Prince, on unwittingly
    "accepting service," said to the astute lawyer's clerk, "Mais,
    Monsieur, ce n'est pas le moment." To which the clerk replied,
    "also in French," says the <i>Standard</i>, "One time is as
    good as another." But why was not the lawyer's clerk's French
    as she is spoke given as well as that of M. le Duc? And how
    much more telling it would have been had M. le Duc been served
    well and faithfully by a clerk like <i>Perker's Mr. Lowten</i>,
    fresh, very fresh, from a carouse at the "Magpie and Stump," or
    even by one of <i>Messrs. Dodson and Fog's</i> young men who
    enjoyed themselves so much when "a twigging" of the virtuous
    <i>Mr. Pickwick</i>.</p>

    <p>"Mais, Monsieur, ce n'est pas le moment," says the Duke, to

    <h2>THE TRAVELLING COMPANIONS</h2>

    <p class="center">No. XIV.</p>

    <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>Gardens belonging to the H&ocirc;tel du Parc,
    Lugano. Time, afternoon; the orchestra is tuning up in a
    kiosk.</i> CULCHARD <i>is seated on a bench in the shade,
    keeping an anxious eye upon the opposite door.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). She said she had a
    headache, and made her father and VAN BOODELER go out on the
    lake without her. But she certainly gave me to understand that
    she might come out when the band played, if she felt better.
    The question is, whether she <i>means</i> to feel better or
    not. She is the most tantalising girl! <i>I</i> don't know what
    to make of her. Not a single reference, as yet, to that last
    talk we had at Bingen. I must see if I can't recall it to her
    memory&mdash;if she comes. I'll wait here, on the chance of
    it&mdash;we are not likely to be dis&mdash;&mdash;. Confound it
    all&mdash;PODBURY! (<i>with suppressed irritation as</i>
    PODBURY <i>comes up</i>). Well, do you <i>want</i> anything in
    particular?</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> (<i>cheerfully, as he sits down</i>). Only the
    pleasure of your society, old chap. How nicely you do put
    things!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> The&mdash;er&mdash;fact is, I can't promise to
    be a particularly lively companion just now.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Not by way of a change? Ah, well, it's a
    pity&mdash;but I must put up with you as you are, I suppose.
    You see&mdash;(<i>with a grin</i>)&mdash;I've got that vow to
    work out.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Possibly&mdash;but <i>I</i> haven't. As I've
    already told you&mdash;I retire.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> Wobbled back to Miss TROTTER again, eh? Matter
    of taste, of course, but, for my part, I think your
    <i>first</i> impression of her was nearer the truth&mdash;she's
    not what I call a highly cultivated sort of girl, y' know.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> You are naturally exacting on that point, but
    have the goodness to leave my first impressions alone,
    and&mdash;er&mdash;frankly, PODBURY, I see no necessity
    (<i>now</i>, at all events) to take that
    ridiculous&mdash;hum&mdash;penance <i>too</i> literally. We are
    <i>travelling</i> together, and I imagine that is enough for
    Miss PRENDERGAST.</p>

    <p><i>Podb.</i> It's enough for <i>me</i>&mdash;especially when
    you make yourself so doosid amiable as this. You needn't alarm
    yourself&mdash;you won't have any more of my company than I can
    help; only I <i>must</i> say, for two fellows who came out to
    do a tour <i>together</i>,
    it's&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>Walks away,
    grumbling.</i></p>

    <p><i>Later. The band has finished playing;</i> Miss TROTTER
    <i>is on the bench with</i> CULCHARD.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> And you mean to tell me you've never met
    anybody since you even cared to converse with?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>diplomatically</i>). Does that strike you
    as so very incredible?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, it strikes me as just a <i>little</i>
    too thin. I judged you'd go away, and forget I ever
    existed.</p>

             alt="Ah, how little you know me!" /></a> "Ah, how
             little you know me!"
    </div>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with tender reproach</i>). How little you
    know me! I may not be an&mdash;er&mdash;demonstrative man,
    my&mdash;er&mdash;feelings are not easily roused, but, once
    roused, well&mdash;(<i>wounded</i>)&mdash;I think I may claim
    to possess an ordinary degree of constancy!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> Well, I'm sure I <i>ought</i> to feel it a
    vurry high compliment to have you going round grieving all this
    time on <i>my</i> account.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Grieving! Ah, if I could only <i>tell</i> you
    what I went through! (<i>Decides, on reflection, that the less
    he says about this the better.</i>) But all that is past. And
    now may I not expect a more definite answer to the question I
    asked at Bingen? Your reply then was&mdash;well, a little
    ambiguous.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I guess it's got to be just about as
    ambiguous now&mdash;there don't seem anything I <i>can</i> say.
    There's times when I feel as if it might be sort of elevating
    and improving to have you shining around; and there's other
    times when I suspect that, if it went on for any considerable
    period, likely I'd weaken. I'm not just sure. And I can't ever
    make myself believe but what you're disapproving of me, inside
    of you, most all the time!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Pray dismiss such&mdash;er&mdash;morbid
    misgivings, dear Miss TROTTER. Show that you do so by accepting
    me as your guide and companion through life!</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> My! but that sounds like a proposal?</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> I intended it to bear
    that&mdash;er&mdash;construction. It <i>is</i> a
    proposal&mdash;made after the fullest reflection.</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> I'm ever so obliged. But we don't fix things
    quite that way in my country. We want to feel pretty sure,
    first, we shann't get left. And it don't seem to me as if I'd
    had opportunities enough of studying your leading
    characteristics. I'll have to study them some more before I
    know whereabouts I am; and I want you to understand that I'm
    not going to commit myself to anything at present. That mayn't
    be sentiment, but I guess it's common-sense, anyway. And all
    <i>you</i>'ve got to do is, just to keep around, and kind of
    impress me with a conviction that you're the vurry brightest
    and best man in the entire universe, and I don't believe you'll
    find much difficulty about <i>that</i>. And now I guess we'll
    go into <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i>&mdash;I'm just as
    <i>ravenous</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself, as he follows her</i>).
    Really, this is not much better than RUSKIN, after all. But I
    don't despair. That last remark was distinctly encouraging!</p>

    <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>A large Salle &agrave; Manger, decorated in
    the Pompeian style. Table d'h&ocirc;te has begun.</i> CULCHARD
    <i>is seated between</i> Miss TROTTER <i>and a large and
    conversational stranger. Opposite are three empty
    chairs.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culchard's Neighbour</i>. Then you're going on to Venice?
    Well, you take <i>my</i> advice. When you get there, you ask
    for tunny. Don't forget&mdash;<i>tunny</i>!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>who wants to talk to</i> Miss T.) Tunny?
    Thank you. I&mdash;er&mdash;will certainly remember his name,
    if I require a guide.</p>

    <p><i>His N.</i> A guide? No, no&mdash;tunny's a <i>fish</i>,
    Sir, a coarse red fish, with flesh like a raw beefsteak.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> Is that so? Then I will make a point of asking
    for it&mdash;if I want raw beefsteak.</p>

    <p>[<i>Attempts to turn to</i> Miss T.</p>

    <p><i>His N.</i> That's what <i>I</i> did when I was at Venice.
    I sent for the Manager. He came. I said to him. "Look here, I'm
    an Englishman. My name's BELLERBY. (CULCHARD <i>bows in patient
    boredom.</i>) I've heard of your Venetian tunny. I wish to
    taste it. <i>Bring</i> me some!"</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>crushingly</i>). A most excellent method
    of obtaining it, no doubt. (<i>To</i> Waiter.) <i>Num&eacute;ro
    vingt-sept, demi bouteille de Chianti, et siphon!</i></p>

    <p><i>His N.</i> You don't wait till I've <i>done</i>, Sir! I
    <i>didn't</i> obtain it&mdash;not at first. The man made
    excuses. I was prepared for <i>that</i>. I told him plainly, "I
    know what <i>you</i>'re thinking&mdash;it's a cheap fish, and
    you fancy I'm ordering it out of economy!"</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>raising his eyebrows for</i> Miss T.'s
    <i>benefit</i>). Of course, he naturally <i>would</i> think so.
    And <i>that</i> is how you got your tunny? I
    see.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Mr. BELLERBY <i>stares at him
    suspiciously, and decides to suppress the remainder of his
    tunny.</i></p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> This hotel seems to be thinning some. We've
    three ghosts right in front of us this evening.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>turning with effusion</i>). So we have! My
    friend is one, and he'll be here presently, but I much prefer
    myself to see every seat occupied. There is something so
    depressing about a vacant chair, don't you think?</p>

    <p><i>Miss T.</i> It's calculated to put one in mind of
    <i>Macbeth's</i> little dinner-party, certainly. But you can
    cheer up, Mr. CULCHARD, here comes a couple of belated
    <i>Banquos.</i> My gracious; I <i>do</i> like that girl's
    face&mdash;she has such a perfectly lovely expression, and
    looks real superior
    too!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page233"
       id="page233"></a>[pg 233]</span> <i>Culch.</i> (<i>who has
       just dropped his glasses into his soup</i>).
       I&mdash;ah&mdash;which lady are you referring too? (<i>He
       cleans and adjusts his glasses&mdash;to discover that he is
       face to face with</i> Miss HYPATIA PRENDERGAST.) Oh ...
       I&mdash;I see&mdash;precisely, quite so! (<i>He turns to</i>
       BELLERBY <i>to cover his confusion and avoid meeting</i>
       Miss PRENDERGAST'S <i>eye</i>.) I <i>beg</i> your pardon,
       you were describing how you caught a tunny? Pray continue.

    <p><i>Mr. Bellerby</i> (<i>stiffly</i>). Excuse me, I don't
    seem fortunate enough to have secured your undivided
    attention.</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with intense interest</i>). Quite the
    contrary, I assure you! You were saying you always ordered it
    out of economy?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Pardon <i>me</i>&mdash;I was saying nothing of
    the sort. I was saying that I told the Manager I knew that was
    why he <i>thought</i> I ordered it&mdash;a rather different
    thing! "You're quite wrong," I said. "You may pay
    twopence-halfpenny a pound for it, and charge me half-a-crown,
    if you like, but I mean to <i>taste</i> that tunny!" I was
    determined not to be done out of my tunny, Sir!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>breathlessly</i>). And what did the
    tunny&mdash;I mean the Manager&mdash;say to <i>that</i>?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> Oh, made more difficulties&mdash;it wasn't to
    be got, and so on. At last I said to him (very quietly, but he
    saw I was in earnest), "Now I tell you what it
    <i>is</i>&mdash;I'm going to <i>have</i> that tunny, and, if
    you refuse to give it me,&mdash;well, I shall just send my
    courier <i>out</i> for it, that's all!" So, with, <i>that</i>,
    they brought me some&mdash;and anything more delicious I never
    tasted in all my life!</p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>to himself</i>). If I can only keep him on
    at this tunny! (<i>Aloud.</i>) And&mdash;er&mdash;what
    <i>does</i> it taste like exactly, now?</p>

    <p><i>Mr. B.</i> (<i>pregnantly</i>), You <i>order</i> it,
    Sir&mdash;<i>insist</i> on having it. Then you'll <i>know</i>
    what it tastes like!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [<i>He devotes
    himself to his soup.</i></p>

    <p><i>Culch.</i> (<i>with his eyes lowered&mdash;to
    himself</i>). I <i>must</i> look up in another minute&mdash;and
    then!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>He shivers.</i></p>

    Magnates of the Theatrical Profession&mdash;beg pardon,
    "<i>the</i> Profession," we should have said&mdash;Mrs.
    BANCROFT made a telling impromptu speech, and then Mr. YARDLEY,
    ancient Cricketer and Modern Dramatist, was hit on the
    head&mdash;accidentally, of course&mdash;by the bottle which is
    in use on these occasions. "Very YARDLEY treated," observed Sir
    DRURIOLANUS, in his happiest vein. Not the first literary gent
    who, according to the ancient slang of the Tom-and-Jerry
    period, has been "cut" by ill-use of the bottle. But the
    unfortunate author's sorrows did not end with this sad blow,
    as, very soon afterwards, his dear friends the Critics, with
    profuse apologies for being compelled to handle him so
    severely, were down upon him for his new version of a French
    piece, entitled <i>The Planter</i>. So the logical sequence of
    events was, that first a blow was planted, and then appeared

    <p>Sir,&mdash;Let me first express my financial acknowledgments
    to the teeming millions who have honoured me, and benefited
    themselves by seeking my advice since my first letter appeared
    last week. Communications containing cheques, postal orders,
    and stamps, have poured in upon me in one unceasing torrent.
    The consignors have, in every case, been good enough to say
    that they handed all they possessed over to me, in the full
    confidence that I would invest the proceeds to the best
    advantage in some of the countless undertakings in which I
    wield a paramount influence. Their trust is fully deserved.</p>

    <p>Investors will remember that, in the course of the last
    German Expedition to Central Africa, a tract of country, rich
    in every mineral deposit, and admirably fitted for the
    operations of husbandry, was discovered in lat. 42&deg;, long.
    65&deg;. The Germans at that time had not a single handkerchief
    left, and were unable, therefore to hoist the German flag over
    the palace of the native king, GUL-GULL. Private information of
    this was conveyed to me. I at once fitted out an Expedition
    <i>at my own expense</i>, placed myself at the head of it, and
    after terrible hardships, in the course of which no less than
    two hundred of my comrades either succumbed outright to the
    bite of the poisonous <i>contango</i> fly, or had to be
    mercifully dispatched by the hammer (a painless native form of
    death), in order to end their tortures, I succeeded in reaching
    the capital, where I was hospitably received by the king. After
    a negotiation of three weeks, His Majesty agreed, in the
    kindest and most affable manner, to concede to me his whole
    country together with all its revenues, minerals, royalties,
    timber, water-power, lakes, farm-houses, stock and
    manor-houses, the whole beautifully situated in the heart of a
    first-class sporting country, within easy reach of ten packs of
    hounds; the old residential palace replete with every modern
    comfort, and admirably adapted for the purposes of a gentleman
    desiring to set up in the business of kingship. It matters not
    what I had to pay for this. The secret is my own, and shall go
    to Westminster Abbey with me. The point is, that with the funds
    entrusted to me, I have formed the Cent-per-Central African
    Exploration and Investment Syndicate, and have allotted shares
    to all those whose contributions have come to hand. As to
    profit, I have calculated it on the strictest actuarial
    principles, and find it cannot be less than &pound;100 for
    every &pound;100 invested. This may seem small, but in these
    matters moderation is the soul of business. I shall have more
    to say on this subject next week.</p>

    <p>AN APPARENTLY HARD CASE.&mdash;Miss Print is responsible for
    a great deal. The other day a tender-hearted person read in a
    daily paper, that a stranger "arriving in Paris, did not even
    know where to go and die." How sad! But the compositor had only
    omitted the "n" from the last word of the sentence. So it
    wasn't so bad after all, though for the stranger bad
    enough.</p>

    <p>A NEW TREASURE FOR. THE TREASURER OF
    BARTHOLOMEW'S.&mdash;<i>Mr. Punch</i>, G.P.E., General
    President of Everything, begs to congratulate Professor HUBERT
    HERKOMER, R.A.M.A., on his admirable portrait of Sir SYDNEY
    HEDLEY, and now, not only HEDLEY, but Full-Lengthly WATERLOW,
    Bart., of "Bart's," which H.R.H. correctly described as "a very
    fine work of Art, painted by one of our most eminent artists."
    Such approbation of Sir HUBERT HERKOMER is praise indeed!
    <i>Mr. Punch</i>, G.P.E., prefixes the "Sir" prophetically. For
    the present it may be taken as the last syllable, detached, of
    "Profes-sir"</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"WELLS, I NEVER!"&mdash;"Mr. WELLS," says the <i>Times</i>
    Correspondent, "has made 250,000 francs" (up to now), and "last
    year he made &pound;20,000." Talk of the waters at various
    drinking or health-resorts abroad, why, their fame is as
    nothing compared with the unprecedented success of the WELLS of
    Monte Carlo. How the other chaps who lose must be like LEECH'S
    old gent "a cussin' and a swearin' like hanythink." So the two
    extremes at Monte Carlo may be expressed by the name of a
    well-known shopkeeping London firm, <i>i.e.</i>, SWEARS AND
    WELLS.</p>

    <h3>NOTHING LIKE LABOR.</h3>(<i>A Pleasant Prospect suggested
    by the evidence taken before the Royal Commission</i>.)

    <p>And so the Un-employed rose from the ditch in which he had
    passed the night, and made for the town. It was early morning,
    and he thought he could possibly get something to do at the
    baker's.</p>

    <p>"Want to work?" cried the foreman. "Why, my good fellow, it
    is all over for the next two days. The trade only allows four
    hours, so we begin at eight on one night, and carry it on until
    four on the following morning. People get their loaves a little
    stale, but old bread is said to be good for the digestion!"</p>

    <p>So the Unemployed went on until he came to a half-built
    house. The workmen had left, but there was still a watchman on
    the premises.</p>

    <p>"Want to work! Why <i>what</i> are you thinking about! Why,
    our trade only allows two hours a day, so we build a house by
    laying foundation-stones. It is rather slow, but very
    sure."</p>

    <p>So the starving man continued his journey. He was
    unsuccessful at every trade centre. One industry allowed its
    members to work only for three hours a day, another two, a
    third four, and so on. There was only one exception to the
    rule, and this (so the doctor thinks) was caused by necessity.
    The undertakers were fully employed twelve hours out of the
    twenty-four. Even the public-houses were closed at noon. The
    workhouses and casual wards were never empty.</p>

    <p>But being of a sanguine temperament, the Unemployed cheered
    his drooping spirits by murmuring, "Better luck to-morrow!"
    Then he retired to his rather damp quarters in the country
    ditch!</p>

    <blockquote>
        "APPARENT DUPLICITY OF JUPITER'S SATELLITE No. 1."
    </blockquote>

    <p>Except that the stars are given to wink, I have never before
    heard of the Heavenly Bodies being accused, of immorality. It
    is true that the duplicity is said to be only "apparent" or
    alleged, but this is doubtless due to the precaution of the
    scientist to escape an action for libel. Flatterers have often
    been accused of this vice, and Satellites are not much better.
    A "Star" on the stage might perhaps thus acknowledge the
    presence of a friend and admirer in the Stalls or in the
    charmed Circle. But for a Heavenly Body to be guilty of
    duplicity, and above all for a "Number One" Heavenly Body, is
    too much. No more will the simple lines</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Twinkle, twinkle, little Star!"
    </blockquote>

    <p>be true. No; if "Jupiter's Satellite No. 1" takes to such
    light conduct, then shall we, have to read</p>

    <blockquote>
        "Wink, O wink, you little Star!"
    </blockquote>

    <p>Henceforth let astronomers be very careful what observations
    they make. To what a state of things are we coming, when at
    night all the sublunary world is nodding, and the Stars above
    are winking. If there's duplicity in a Satellite of Jupiter,
    how about Jupiter itself? Can we henceforth put any trust in
    the Planets? Are they in league with deceitful soothsayers,
    astrologers, and fortune-tellers? I cannot further pursue the
    painful subject. We owe a debt of gratitude to the <i>Times</i>
    for exposing duplicity in the highest places. Imagine treachery
    in Aurora Borealis! What an awful flirt she would be!! How
    she'd "wink the other eye!"</p>

    <p>FROM MASHONALAND.&mdash;Inspired by the success of ARTHUR
    B., of DE GORSTIBUS NON DISPUTANDUM, and of Sir KETTLE-DRUMMOND
    WOLFF, our GRANDOLPH meditates a surprise return to his own
    native land and to Parliamentary life. He announces his
    intention of changing his name, and will call himself "Lord NIL
    DESPERANDUM CHURCHILL." Hail to the modern Coeur-de-Lion!"</p>

    <p>MR. FARMER-ATKINSON, M.P., attending the American Methodist
    Conference, has been supplying the United States with
    interesting illustrations of House of Commons manners.
    Incidentally he observed that Primitive Methodists, members of
    which body were largely represented in his audience, are
    "impostors." This led to some misunderstanding, and Mr.
    FARMER-ATKINSON, M.P., found it necessary to explain that he
    had used the term "simply in a Parliamentary sense." We learn
    by special Zadkiel telegram that, on emerging from the Hall
    after the meeting, the Rev. HERCULES EBENEZER (Omaha), bringing
    down his clenched fist on the crown of the hat of Mr.
    FARMER-ATKINSON, M.P., altered its situation in a direction
    that temporarily obscured the vision of the Hon. Member.</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?" inquired Mr. FARMER-ATKINSON, M.P.,
    struggling out of the wreck of his hat.</p>

    <p>"I mean it in a purely Pickwickian sense," said the Rev.
    HERCULES EBENEZER (Omaha), with a seraphic smile that disarmed
    controversy.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The GERMAN EMPEROR has lately rearranged his scheme of work
    for weekdays. From six A.M. to eight A.M. he gives lectures on
    Strategy and Tactics to Generals over forty years old. From
    eight to ten he instructs the chief actors, musicians and
    painters of Berlin in the principles of their respective arts.
    The hours from ten to twelve he devotes to the compilation of
    his Memoirs in fifty-four volumes. A limited edition of
    large-paper copies is to be issued. From twelve to four P.M. he
    reviews regiments, cashiers colonels, captures fortresses,
    carries his own dispatches to himself, and makes speeches of
    varying length to all who will listen to him. Any professional
    reporter found taking accurate notes of His Majesty's words is
    immediately blown from a Krupp gun with the new smokeless
    powder. From four to eight he tries on uniforms, dismisses
    Ministers and officials, dictates state-papers to General
    CAPRIVI, and composes his history of "How I pricked the
    Bismarck Bubble." From eight to eleven P.M. His Majesty teaches
    schoolmasters how to teach, wives how to attend to their
    families, bankers how to carry on their business, and cooks how
    to prepare dinners. The rest of the day he devotes to himself.
    On Thursday next His Majesty leaves Berlin on his tenth visit
    to the European Courts.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is no truth in the report that the Lord CHANCELLOR is
    arranging a Christmas party, to which shall be invited all the
    members and connections of his family for whom he has found
    places during his term of office. It is well known that the
    accommodation at Lord HALSBURY's town residence is
    comparatively limited.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>We regret to hear that Mr. JOHN O'CONNOR, M.P. (known in the
    House of Commons as "Long JOHN"), has decided to retire from
    political life. His personal experience during the Cork
    Election has convinced him that no man over 5 ft. 8 in. can
    safely take part in active politics.</p>

    <p>"Bricks, dead cats, sections of chimney-pots, which flew
    harmless over the heads of the crowd, invariably struck me,"
    said Mr. O'CONNOR, toying with the bandage over his left
    eyebrow.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is quite true, as reported in the newspapers, that Dr.
    GUTTERIDGE was not present when the final result of the polling
    in the Strand was made known, and that it was explained to the
    reporter he had been "called out to see a patient." The
    suggestion that the undertaking of this hopeless contest was
    designed solely to lead up to this incident, is one worthy only
    of the diseased imagination of a professional rival, who has no
    patients to call him out&mdash;even from Church.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>It is stated (and has been denied) that Herr VON DER
    BLOWITZOWN-TROMP is about to retire from his supervision of
    universal affairs exercised through the Special Paris Wire of a
    contemporary. We are glad to learn that this intention does not
    in any case imply absolute disappearance from the European
    Stage. It is no secret in diplomatic circles that the Herr has
    been approached on the question of his ascending the throne of
    Bulgaria. His keen insight into European politics has convinced
    him that this arrangement would afford a settlement of an
    ever-ruffled question. He has, we understand, stipulated that
    the Principality shall be raised to the status of a Kingdom. "I
    have," he said to the Emissary of the Powers who approached him
    on the subject, "been so long accustomed to associate with
    Crowned Heads, that in a Principality I should feel like a fish
    out of water."</p>

    <p>With his usual considerateness, Herr VON DER
    BLOWITZOWN-TROMP has recognised the inconvenience that would be
    imposed on his subjects, if, in daily use, they were obliged to
    refer to him by his full title. He will, therefore, deign to be
    known on coins, postage-stamps, and in semi-official
    communications, as TROMP THE FIRST.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>There is no truth in the report that, on behalf of Mr. JOHN
    MORLEY, Sir WILLIAM HARCOURT waited upon Mr. CHAMBERLAIN, and
    asked him to name a friend; that the Right Hon. Gentleman
    "mentioned" Mr. JESSE COLLINGS; and that the two seconds have
    arranged a meeting at Boulogne. The idle rumour doubtless arose
    out of the fact that an acrimonious correspondence between the
    two former friends has been carried on in the columns of the
    <i>Times</i>.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>According to the newspaper reports, during the ceremony of
    acceptance by the Prince of WALES, as President of
    Bartholomew's Hospital, of "the portrait of Sir SYDNEY
    WATERLOW, the Treasurer," the portrait "occupied a prominent
    position on the platform, and the Hon. Baronet sat immediately
    in front of it." We learn that this arrangement led to some
    misunderstanding, people, on entering, not at first knowing
    which was the portrait, and which was Sir SYDNEY.</p>

individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
